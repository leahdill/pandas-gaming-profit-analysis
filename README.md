# pandas-challenge

In this Heroes of Pymoli challenge, I was tasked with breaking down key data for a gaming
company which would allow them to develop their marketing strategies for in-game purchases.

The dataset provided gave us purchasing data, but was messy in that it lists multiple
transactions per user, so the first task was determining how many users there actually are.
Then I broke out how many items there are for purchase, how many purchases had been made, and 
the revenue from those purchases.

The company wanted a demographic breakdown, both by gender and age, so I returned a total count 
broken down by male, female, other, and age groups, as well as how much each spends on items.

Lastly, the company wanted to know who their top spenders were and which items generated the
most revenue. 

Key metrics to note:

Males make up 84% of this game's population, while females make up 14%.
The age group that contributes the most revenue in purchases is the 20-24 crowd.
Lisosia93 is the biggest spender.
Final Critic is the most popular AND most profitable item for purchase.
